**M35 review synthesis**: [`enterprise-review-m35.md`](./enterprise-review-m35.md) (#388) — ranked P0/P1/P2 backlog after multi-lane residual review (historical; #389/#390 done)  
**Active wave**: board clean after **v0.8.29** / Milestone 39; next residual only with ACs (**v0.8.30+**)

## Purpose

Give the next residual / product wave a single honest backlog of high-leverage leftovers. Status labels:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| residual | Explicit non-product or 501/log-only path |
| partial | Related surface exists; upstream intent incomplete |
| present | Shipped enough to drop from active residual queue |
| design-only | Evaluation/spike docs exist; no runtime path |

## Candidates

| ID | Title | Status | Evidence | Recommended wave | Risk |
|----|-------|--------|----------|------------------|------|
| WS-1 | Full Responses WebSocket Codex path | residual | `handler/proxy/responses_ws.go` (426 plain GET / 501 upgrade); `docs/analysis/responses-websocket-residual.md` (#217/#274) | Dedicated Milestone after Codex interop ACs | High protocol + multi-instance sticky interaction |
| STICKY-B | Redis sticky map (option B) | design-only | `proxy/session.go` process-local `stickyBindings`; `docs/analysis/sticky-session-multi-instance-residual.md` (#237/#282); design spike #292 | Only if multi-instance sticky is product-critical and LB pin is unavailable | Hot-path Redis; must fail-open like sharedcount |
| UC-1 | Update-center remote registry / deploy | residual | `scheduler/update_center.go` log-only; admin deploy/rollback/SSE **501**; `docs/analysis/residual-update-center.md` (#283) | Product Milestone with real registry client | Ops safety; no fake updateAvailable |
| TEST-1 | Admin proxy/chat stream + job queue harness | residual | `handler/admin/test.go` stream/jobs **501** / job not-found; sync path aliases forced-channel harness; `docs/analysis/admin-channel-test-harness.md` (#291) | Optional UX polish; sync harness already present | Low if residual stays honest |
| P0-568 | Relay keys force-marked expired | **present** (#298/#301) | `ShouldMarkAccountExpired` + `ReportTokenExpired` ClassExpired guard; bare/generic 401 no longer marks | Done for mark path; novel wording residual only | Residual wording gaps |
| P0-585 | Channel failure cascade poison | **partial** (hardened #299/#302; honesty #336; M39 slices #423–#425 present) | **Shipped:** channel-scoped `excludeChannelIDs`, non-usage-limit cooldown write isolation, 429 failover, same-channel timeout budget, multi-channel same-site conductor + routing isolation tests; preferred open-breaker decline (#423/#430); CooldownUntil parse eligibility (#424/#427); conductor hard attempt budget + nil RefreshAuth failover (#425/#431). **Still residual:** credential-scoped usage-limit multi-channel cool; empty-filter global full-set fallback; **no production multi-channel load proof**. Detail: `docs/analysis/failover-isolation.md` §P0-585 honesty | Load-proof / empty-filter only with dedicated AC (**v0.8.30+**) | Medium residual — do not claim #585 present |
| REL-PREFERRED-BREAKER | SelectPreferredChannel ignores open site/model breaker on single preferred | **present** (#423/#430) | Preferred path checks Global/Model breaker directly (does not rely on `FilterSiteRuntimeBrokenCandidatesByModel` len<=1 short-circuit); open breaker + siblings → nil / fall through to normal selection | Done for preferred/sticky open-breaker | Residual novel sticky pin paths only with AC |
| REL-COOLDOWN-TS | CooldownUntil eligibility lex string compare | **present** (#424/#427) | `IsCooldownActive` parses millis ISO / RFC3339 both sides to ms for selector/explain/OAuth cool; now+500ms still ineligible | Done for eligibility parse | Residual novel cooldown writers only if product AC |
| REL-CONDUCTOR-BUDGET | Conductor missing hard attempt budget + nil RefreshAuth failover | **present** (#425/#431) | `DefaultProxyConductor` enforces MaxAttempts across same-channel + refresh + failover; caps RefreshAuth successes then fail over; nil/error RefreshAuth → ActionFailover + channel-scoped exclude | Done for hard budget + nil RefreshAuth failover | Residual load-proof / other conductor policies only with AC |
| P0-555 | Token usage statistics inaccurate | **present-with-residual** (#300/#311/#319/#345/#350/#400) | Disconnect partial + failure proxy_logs with usage (#311); aggregation projects non-success tokens into `failed_calls` + `total_tokens` (#319 regression); OpenAI chat + legacy completions stream `stream_options.include_usage` inject (#345/#350); stream-end `slog.Warn` when include_usage requested but no usable tokens extracted (#400 — never invents counts). Residual: provider-ignored flag, media zeros, multi-instance lag, orphan site join — not perfect billing | Residual polish only | Billing/ops trust residual |
| P1-580 | Gemini thought_signature tool history | **present** (#86 transform + #309 proxy wire) | `NormalizeRequest` / OpenAI↔Gemini rebuild + `sanitizeUpstreamJSONBody` on gemini native/cli generateContent; residual: no multi-instance aggregate store | Done for request-side; session re-attach only if product needs | Residual multi-instance only |

Residual: further dialects only with ACs; null/non-positive context_length still skips enforce; no silent clamp | Further dialect polish only with ACs | OpenAI + Claude enforce present; other dialects residual |
| SEC-MONITOR | Monitor session cookie embeds live AUTH_TOKEN | **present** (opaque session #407/#414; logout clear #417/#421) | Opaque HMAC-SHA256 monitor session; `ensureMonitorAuth` constant-time compare; cookie scoped `Path=/monitor-proxy/` so capture cannot become full admin bearer. Admin logout / session clear sets `Max-Age=0` for `meta_monitor_auth` with matching Path (#417/#421). Residual: rotate/invalidate on auth_token change only with product AC | Done for opaque session + logout clear | Residual rotate-on-token-change only with AC |
| SEC-AUTH-TIMING | Admin token change OldToken compare | **present** (#408/#411) | `handler/admin/auth_settings.go` uses `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` on equal-length normalized bytes; mismatched lengths rejected without leaking timing (parity with AdminAuth middleware) | Done for token-change path | Residual other non-constant compares only if product AC |

Regression: public origin 302 → 169.254/loopback must error and not fetch target body | Done for RuntimeExecutor + bare probe/harness/defaultUpstreamClient | Residual novel client constructors only if product AC |
| REL-SOFT | Weighted soft-filter empty → next priority | **present** (#358/#362) | Weighted path skips soft-empty priority layer and tries next; failover-isolation note | Done for weighted soft-filter | P0-585 empty-filter fallback residual separate |
| SEC-ADMIN | Remaining admin secret surfaces | **present-with-residual** (#367/#372) | Account list redacts accessToken/apiToken + passwordCipher strip; token list drops join secrets. Residual: create/update/rebind may still echo once; intentional credential export | Done for list/overview | Residual intentional export / create-once |

| SEC-HTTPURL | IsValidHTTPURL / externalCheckin metadata | **present** (#382/#385) | `IsValidHTTPURL` rejects metadata/link-local class via `IsForbiddenSiteTargetURL`; externalCheckin uses hardened check | Done | RFC1918/localhost intentionally allowed |
| PERF-ROUTES | GET /api/routes N+1 channel queries | **present** (#383/#386; test residual closed #390/#395) | Single channels JOIN for listed routes, group in memory; response shape + #375 redact unchanged; multi-route list regression + secret redact covered by `TestListRoutes_MultiRouteBatchChannelLoadAndRedaction` | Done for routes list batch-load | Residual other admin list N+1 only if product AC |
| SEC-ENDPOINT | Site API endpoint admin normalize + service validator | **present** (#389/#396 + #398/#403) | Admin `normalizeAPIEndpointsInput` rejects forbidden targets with clear 400 before upsert; `IsValidAPIEndpointURL` itself rejects metadata/link-local (parity with `IsValidHTTPURL` / `IsForbiddenSiteTargetURL`) so any caller is safe by default | Done for admin early-reject + base validator parity | RFC1918/localhost intentionally allowed |

## Recommended sequencing (v0.8.30+)

1. **Shipped in v0.8.29**: #423–#426 (PRs #427/#428/#430/#431) — REL-PREFERRED-BREAKER preferred open-breaker decline · REL-COOLDOWN-TS parse eligibility · REL-CONDUCTOR-BUDGET hard attempt budget + nil RefreshAuth failover · residual honesty. Prior v0.8.28: #416–#418. Prior v0.8.27: #407–#410. Prior v0.8.26: #397–#400. M35–M39 closed.
2. **Board clean after M39** — next residual wave only with product ACs (**v0.8.30+**). Do not invent a board without Issue ACs.
3. **REL-PREFERRED-BREAKER** / **REL-COOLDOWN-TS** / **REL-CONDUCTOR-BUDGET** fully **present**. **SEC-REDIR** fully **present** (RuntimeExecutor + bare probe/harness/defaultUpstreamClient). **SEC-MONITOR** fully **present** for opaque session + logout clear (rotate/invalidate on auth_token change only with product AC). **SEC-AUTH-TIMING** fully **present**. **CTX-520** stays **present-with-residual** (OpenAI + Claude max_tokens reject shipped; further dialects / null-context residual). **P0-555** stays **present-with-residual** (warn shipped; provider-ignore / media / lag / orphan join residual).
4. **P0-585** remains **partial** until production load-proof / empty-filter / credential-scope ACs land (M39 slices #423–#425 present; do not claim #585 present).
5. **Optional product later**: P0-585 production load-proof; deeper billing polish; further dialect context_length enforce (dedicated ACs only).
6. **Product Milestones only with ACs**: WS-1 Codex interop, STICKY-B Redis sticky, UC-1 update-center registry.
7. **Do not** invent shared sticky, WS completions, or updateAvailable without the matching Milestone.

## Explicit non-goals for residual waves

- Fake WS frames or Hijack-then-silent-close.
- Claiming cluster-wide sticky while bindings remain process-local.
- Inventing update-center deploy/rollback success without a registry.
- Returning `success:true` for unimplemented admin stream/job queues.
- Claiming perfect billing accuracy without aggregation proof after #311.
- Claiming all-dialect proxy max-token enforcement from `contextLength` without a dedicated product AC (OpenAI chat/completions after #399; Claude `/v1/messages` after #409; further dialects need ACs).
- Returning full downstream API keys on admin list/summary/overview after #355.
- Allowing custom_headers to override Authorization/Host/hop-by-hop after #356.
- Following cross-origin/private RuntimeExecutor or bare probe/harness/defaultUpstreamClient redirects after #357/#416.
- Embedding live `AUTH_TOKEN` in monitor cookies after #407; leaving `meta_monitor_auth` set after admin logout after #417.
- Non-constant-time compares on admin token-change paths after #408.
- Claiming preferred/sticky selection ignores open site/model breakers after #423.
- Claiming CooldownUntil eligibility uses lex string compare after #424.
- Claiming conductor lacks a hard cross-channel attempt budget or never fails over on nil RefreshAuth after #425.
